## New Interactive UI Workflow üö¶

### Search for Jobs Directly from the Web App

Winning CV now features an enhanced **web-based user interface** where you can configure your job search and generate tailored CVs without writing a single line of code!

**You can:**
- Search for jobs directly from the app, across multiple job platforms.
- Save your search configurations and update them any time.
- Generate customized CVs for each job with a single click.

### How It Works

1. **Configure Your Search**
   - In the web UI, go to the **"Run Job Search"** section.
   - Upload your base CV (PDF or DOCX).
   - Enter your preferences: location, keywords, number of jobs, etc.
   - For each supported job board, provide the relevant search URL.

2. **LinkedIn & Seek Integration**
   - **LinkedIn:** Paste any LinkedIn job search results URL (for example, after filtering for your desired roles or location on LinkedIn Jobs).
   - **Seek:** Paste any Seek search results URL (after applying filters on seek.com.au).
   - The app will scrape jobs from the URLs you provide, so make sure the URLs represent your search criteria.

3. **Save & Run**
   - Your configuration is saved per user and updated automatically if you change your preferences.
   - Click **"Save & Run Search"** to aggregate job postings from the specified platforms.
   - The app will analyze each job description against your CV and display a list of matches, complete with compatibility scores and download links for tailored resumes.

4. **View & Manage Results**
   - See detailed matching breakdowns for each job found.
   - Download application-ready, AI-tailored CVs instantly.
   - Edit your search configuration any time to refine your job search.

### Supported Job Platforms

- **LinkedIn:** Paste your custom search results URL.
- **Seek:** Paste your custom search results URL.
- **Indeed, Glassdoor, Google Jobs:** Enter keywords or search terms for additional AI-driven aggregation.

> **Note:**
> The quality and relevance of jobs depend on the URLs you provide.
> For best results, use the official job search and filtering tools on each platform to create URLs reflecting your interests, then copy those URLs into the app.

## Example: Using the Web App

1. **Open the Web Dashboard**
   ```
   python webui_new.py
   ```
   Then visit [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

2. **Configure Your Search**
   - Upload your base CV.
   - Paste your job board search URLs:
     - e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=data+scientist&location=Melbourne`
     - e.g., `https://www.seek.com.au/data-scientist-jobs/in-Melbourne`
   - Set job search preferences (location, keywords, etc).

3. **Run and Review**
   - Click **Save & Run Search**.
   - Instantly view all matching jobs with their compatibility scores.
   - Download custom CVs for each match.

## Why Provide URLs?
For job boards like LinkedIn and Seek, the app relies on your search URLs to fetch the most relevant jobs for you. This approach:
- Offers you total control over search filters and criteria.
- Ensures the app always works with the latest job postings displayed to you.
- Makes the system compatible with changing user preferences or platform UI.
